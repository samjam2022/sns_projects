##### Failover setup#######

# ISP-1 interface
int g0/0	
ip dhcp client route track 3
ip nat outside
exit

# ISP-2 interface
int g1/0
ip nat ouside
exit

#Create default route with AD of 10
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 gig 0/0 dhcp 10

#Create tracking object
ip sla 1
icmp-echo 8.8.8.8 source-interface g0/0
frequency 10
exit

#schedule it
ip sla 1 schedule start-time now life forever

#Track the object
track 1 ip sla 1 reachability
exit

#Create 2nd  object
ip sla 2

frequency 10
exit

ip sla schedule 2 start-time now life forever
track 2 ip sla 2 reachability
exit
##VERIFY BOTH OBJECTS ARE BEING TRACKED
do show track brief

#Track 3rd object as a percentage of object 1&2
track 3 list threshold percentage
object 1
object 2
exit
##Verify tracking
do show track 3

#Config Delay
track 3
delay down 15 up 15
exit

##Create Access-list,Route-MAP and Policy
ip access-list extended rmap_isp1 #you can name it whatever you want
permit icmp any host 8.8.8.8
permin icmp any host 4.2.2.2

route-map isp1 #You can name it whatever
match ip address rmap_isp1
set interface gig 0/0
set ip next-hop dhcp
exit

##Verify
do show run | s router-map

ip local policy route-map isp1
