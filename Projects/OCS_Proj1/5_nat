##This is to Set up NAT in our Dual WAN setup

#Define inside and outside interfaces
int f0/0
ip nat outside
exit

int f0/1
ip nat ouside
exit

int f2/0.2 [do this for all sub-interfaces]
ip nat inside
exit

#Create Extended ACL for our LAN IPs
ip access-list extended NAT
permit ip 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
exit

#Create route maps for both outside interfaces
route-map wan1
match ip add NAT
match interface fa0/0
exit

route-map wan2
match ip add NAT
match intface f0/1
exit

ip nat inside source route-map wan1 int f0/0 overload
ip nat inside source route-map wan2 int f0/1 overload

***Verification***
show ip nat trans
show ip nat stat

============================================================
#Thats it! Obviously make sure that your LAN(inside) interface has an IP address
